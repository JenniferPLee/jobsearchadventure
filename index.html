 <p class="greatexperience"> 6 Pieces of Advice on How to Land a Job
<br>
<br>

Dear Job seekers,
<br>
<br>
Thank you for reaching out to me. Your summary of your experience is very impressive. You shouldn't have any problem in finding a good job at all. We have all heard it and I can't tell you how many times a recruiter muttered those words to me. I was always thinking, well maybe I do and it just isn't working for me right now. I'd always listen to the feedback and try to apply whatever is that they said to me to my job search. This helped me realize something: Sometimes just because you have the experience and feel qualified, doesn't mean you will always get a position. Manipulating your resume and tailoring it can help tremendously. Staying positive and having a steady work ethic at getting a job is very important. Try these tips below that I have learned through my grueling, but successful job search.
<br>
<br>

The first tip I would express to you would be don't stress and worry about the position you are in. I, and many other people, were or are in the same position as you trying to land a good job, it's just the way our economy is right now. Getting a job is a job inside of itself. A lot of recruiters expressed this to me. A lot of work has to be done and it's not going to be easy. One of the most important things someone could do is stay positive throughout the whole process and work hard. When you think you had a good day of job searching, put in an extra half hour just to top it off. Hard work and dedication is key and will always payoff if you play your cards right. 
<br>
<br>
The second piece of advice I would give to you is to make sure your LinkedIn profile is as complete as possible. Give detailed descriptions of your duties of your previous experience/college labs or whatever type of experience you have. Fill it out as much as possible and give details about what you did during school like classes, activities joined, etc. (Check my profile for reference) The third thing I'd say would be to network hard on LinkedIn. When I came out of college, I was applying to jobs and really wasn't getting that many responses and chances for even a phone interview. I thought I had good experience similar to you, but it just wasn't working out. So I was thinking about it and was pondering about this site LinkedIn and how it allows us to connect to recruiters who are the people that actually look at your resume and was thinking why not connect to them directly and let them know that I am really searching. A lot of getting a job is showing that you want the job. If you take the time to find recruiters at companies you want to apply too, you will stand out, so that is what I did. For the career I wanted to get into, I researched all the companies that I would see myself working for. A quick search on Google or Bing will help. Find companies in your field and read about them, research them, see where they are going. Think to yourself, "Would I be a good fit for this company?" This is what I did. I am in IT and always wanted to work for a defense contractor and be in the Washington Dc Metro area, so I started there. I found those companies through the LinkedIn search and typed in for example "BAE Systems recruiter." On the left hand side of your search, it will give you more options to narrow your search down to location. I always selected Washington Dc and then a whole list of recruiters came up from the area. I then connected with them with sending a message. I always said the same thing to each recruiter and it was a line similar to this: "Hey I am a recent graduate of Penn State University majoring in this. I am interested in your company and I feel like I could be a great asset to your company. Do you know of any open positions that I would be a good fit for?” (Make this message generic. Don't use specific names of companies, just say what you want so you can use the same message over and over again, but perfect it before you send it to hundreds of recruiters.) 
<br>
<br>
This may sound irrational, but getting a job is a numbers game. Yeah there might be your dream job out there, but if you have your heart set on one company or one position, it will be tougher on you. Think of it as a numbers game. The more times your resume is in front of a recruiter or the more times a recruiter sees your name, the more likely that they are going to remember you and give you an opportunity to get hired. Research your favorite companies and add all the recruiters you can find for their company and message them when you add them. Not all recruiters respond, but you would be surprised on how people respond and the opportunities you would get. This especially helps if you have already applied online at the jobs website to the positions that you are interested in. I recommend doing this first. That just means another time a recruiter sees your name.
<br>
<br>
This other piece of advice is very important as well. You have to make sure your resume is adequate to your experience and skills. Make sure to keep your resume short, but sweet. The average time a recruiter/hiring manager spends on a resume is literally like 30 seconds. If you have on going text or paragraphs, it’s going to be boring to read and they won’t be interested in you. Another thing is that do some research in your field. Perform a Google search for keywords in your field. Make sure that those words are scattered throughout your resume. This is especially good to look through certain job descriptions to learn what skills a company is looking for. If there is a lot of one word, make sure when describing your experience, use that word. It will help immensely. Don’t exaggerate skills or don’t lie on a resume. Make sure that the skills that you list or the experience that you have is relevant to what you did. A recruiter will always know when you aren't being truthful with them.
<br>
<br>
For specific jobs that you really, really want and you think wow this is best job description I have seen and I really want this position, try this method. Read the job description, which is usually bulleted, and customize your resume to that job description. This is similar to using keywords, but this time you are really going to customize it to basically what the job description is, but don't lie about skills or don't copy and paste anything. Just re-word your experience to match it. It sounds difficult, but it really isn't. Once you sit down and try it, then you will perfect it.
<br>
<br>
Other advice I can give to you is join your alumni networks and reach out to your college alumni. They can give you leads and just make sure you network hard on LinkedIn .It might not get you a job right away, but it definitely will in the future. Continue to work at it and don't get down on yourself. You will succeed soon just keep working at it. Remember to listen to the feedback recruiters are telling you and to apply that to your job search or your resume. Listening to what you aren't doing right is very important. No one is an expert at job searching and everyone has different advice. Listen to it all and apply it to your search. Don't give up and never stop trying. Before long you will be a professional writing your own piece of advice to other folks who need the help. Maybe we might even be co-workers at some point.
<br>
<br>
Until then, keep working and keep networking!
<br>
<br>
Best of luck to you!
